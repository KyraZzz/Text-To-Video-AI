Have you ever followed a recipe, put together furniture using instructions, or even just followed a map? If so, you've used an algorithm!
An algorithm is essentially a sequence of steps that you carry out to perform a task. Think of it as a clear, step-by-step guide to solve a problem or complete a task.
In computer science, we use algorithms as the solution to a problem, expressed as a sequence of defined steps.
The text gives an example of a recipe for a cake, like "Mix together all the ingredients," as a simple algorithm. It's a set of steps you follow to get a specific result: a cake! Computer scientists are always looking for "good solutions" â€“ algorithms that give correct results, use resources efficiently like memory and time, and are also clear and easy to understand.
